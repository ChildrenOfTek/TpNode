# TpNode

## Getting started
First install :
    **Node Js**
     **npm**
     **mongoDb**

Simply run the command `npm start` in main directory to automatically install and launch the app.
Run `npm run sd` for dev mode (skipping some dependencies).
Finally, run `npm run run` to skip the install part!
